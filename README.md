# WillowStreetCheckOut

This app is used for business operations at Willow Street. This software serves 
as a first-line audit for financial inaccuries, allowing the Waiters and To-Go workers 
to quickly calculate the cash they are owed by the resturant and the cash they owe other employees.
This app was built using Swift/SwiftUI, additionally a demonstration video is attached as well.
